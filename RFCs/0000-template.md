# Summary

Brief explanation of the feature.

# Example(s)

If the proposal involves a new feature, include a few code examples showing how this feature can be used.
Omit this section if it's not applicable.

# Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected
outcome?

Please focus on explaining the motivation so that if this RFC is not accepted,
the motivation could be used to develop alternative solutions. In other words,
enumerate the constraints you are trying to solve without coupling them too
closely to the solution you have in mind.

# Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this? Please consider:

- implementation cost, both in terms of code size and complexity
- integration of this feature with other existing and planned features
- is this a breaking change?

There are tradeoffs to choosing any path. Attempt to identify them here.

# Limitation

- What are limitations of this feature?
- What are some limited use cases?

# Detailed design

This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody
familiar with CloudFormation to understand, and for somebody familiar with the
implementation to implement. This should get into specifics and corner-cases,
and include examples of how the feature is used. Any new terminology should be
defined here.


# Alternatives considered (optional)

What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

# FAQ
This section should include answers to questions readers will likely ask about this release.

# Appendix
Feel free to add any number of appendices as you see fit. Appendices are expected to allow readers to dive deeper to certain sections if they like. For example, you can include an appendix which describes the detailed design of an algorithm.
